# **Handbook Disclaimer**

We're sharing this handbook openly as part of our fundamental commitment to **transparency** and our belief in **pioneering new models of working**. Unlike traditional employee handbooks kept behind closed doors, we believe in openly documenting and sharing our journey as we experiment with progressive workplace practices.

This handbook represents more than just policiesâ€”it's a living document of our evolving approach to creating a meaningful, human-centered workplace. As we continue to experiment, learn, and refine our practices, this document will evolve alongside us, capturing both our successes and the lessons we learn along the way.

This handbook reflects our current practices and may be updated from time to time to better align with our evolving company culture and business needs. Team Members will be notified of significant changes, but it is each Team Member's responsibility to periodically review the handbook for updates. The most current version of this handbook can always be found \[location\]. If you have questions about any policies or practices, please speak to our People Ops team.

The company reserves the right to amend, modify, or discontinue any of the policies, procedures, or practices outlined in this handbook at any time. While we strive to provide advance notice of significant changes, modifications may occur without prior notification as business needs require.
