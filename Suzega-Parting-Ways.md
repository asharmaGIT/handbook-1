# **Parting Ways**

Suzega recognizes that employment relationships may conclude for various reasons, including voluntary resignation, retirement, or termination. 

When separating from the company, our notice period requirements differ by locationâ€”in the USA, employment is at-will, meaning either the team member or the company may terminate the relationship at any time with or without notice, though a two-week courtesy notice is appreciated. 

In India, team members are required to provide a three-month notice period. 

Upon resignation, team members must submit formal notification to their Project Lead and People Operations, initiating our exit process. This process includes an exit interview, return of all company property, knowledge transfer to colleagues, and completion of department-specific clearance procedures. 

Final compensation will include earned salary, eligible unused paid time off in accordance with company policy. Benefits coverage will terminate on the last day of employment, though continuation options may be available as permitted by law. 

Former team members may be considered for rehire depending on their performance record, circumstances of departure, and current company needs. Suzega appreciates the contributions of all team members and strives to make employment transitions as smooth as possible while protecting company interests and maintaining professional relationships.
