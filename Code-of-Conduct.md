# Code of Conduct 

We take a fundamentally different approach to workplace conduct. Rather than imposing exhaustive rules and micromanaging behavior, we start from a place of respect and trust. We see our Team Members as they truly are: intelligent professionals with valuable experience and sound judgment. Your experience and common sense are your best guides for most situations you'll encounter.
That said, even the best communities need some shared norms. Here are ours:

**Bias towards action -** We value forward momentum over perfect solutions. Make decisions, try new approaches, and adjust as needed rather than getting stuck in analysis paralysis.

**Continuous learning -** Actively seek knowledge, embrace feedback, and view every challenge as an opportunity to grow. Share what you learn to elevate the entire team.

**No blame game -** When things go wrong , focus on solutions, not finding someone to blame. We analyze failures to improve systems, not to point fingers.

**Open to diverse perspectives -** The best solutions emerge when we consider multiple viewpoints. Actively seek out and genuinely consider opinions different from your own.

**Speak directly -** Address issues with people, not about them. If something's wrong, talk to the person who can fix it rather than complaining elsewhere.

The rest is up to you. We trust your judgment.

## Equal Opportunity
We are committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace where everyone feels valued and respected. We firmly believe in providing equal opportunities to all team members and applicants, ensuring that everyone has a fair chance to contribute and succeed.
Our commitment to equality means that we do not discriminate on any grounds, including Race, Caste, Religion, Color, Ancestry, Marital Status, Gender, Sexual Orientation, Age, Nationality, Ethnic Origin, Disability.

We also prohibit discrimination based on any other category protected by applicable law. We are dedicated to creating a work environment where diversity is celebrated, and everyone feels a sense of belonging. We believe that a diverse workforce enriches our perspectives, fosters innovation, and strengthens our ability to serve our clients and communities.
