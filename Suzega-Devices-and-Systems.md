# Staying Connected - Our Devices and Systems

## Work Devices: 
We want all our team members to work seamlessly, to facilitate this all team members are provided with the latest Macbook or Window device tailored to their project requirement. 

## Internal Systems: 
**Google Workspace (External Communication):** We use Google Workspace for all external or client communication 

**Basecamp(Internal Communication):** This is our central hub for team collaboration and company-wide announcements. It keeps all our work organized, transparent, and accessible in one place. We have deliberately moved away from endless email chains and constant group chats. Instead, we have replaced these with thoughtful use of Basecamp features that promote focused work, intentional communication, and respect for everyone's time and attention.

**People Platform :** Our company uses a simple yet powerful People Platform as your one-stop hub for workplace needs. Here you can access policies, download documents, manage leaves, view the holiday calendar, access pay slips, update personal information, and manage training and benefits. You will receive login details during onboarding, with our People Operations team always available for support. We encourage you to explore this tool that will help you streamline your journey with us and have access to the necessary information you need.

**Beyond our standard setup:** If you need any extra hardware or software beyond the standard setup, please talk with your Project Lead
