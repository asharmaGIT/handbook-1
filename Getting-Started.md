# Getting Started 
We have designed a comprehensive onboarding journey to help you settle in and set you up for success. We will provide all the essentials to get you started smoothly, including your login details. Here's what to expect from the moment you accept our offer through the completion of your probation period.

## Pre-boarding
Your journey with us begins before your first day. Upon accepting our offer, you will receive a welcome email with joining details and next steps. We will then provide a secure link for document collection and deliver your welcome kit and laptop one week before your start date. A member of our People Operations team will call you the day before joining to answer any questions and make you feel welcome.

## Initial Days
- **Day 1:** Your first day at Suzega will include getting your company email and Basecamp access, account setup, joining a virtual welcome call to learn about our company culture, and completing necessary paperwork including Team Member agreement and benefits enrollment.
- **Day 2:** On your second day, you will meet your team members, connect with your Project Buddy who will guide you through initial projects, receive our company contacts directory, learn about your business unit and its goals, gain a detailed understanding of your role and responsibilities, and develop your personalized learning and training plan together
- **Day 3-5:** You will complete all required compliance and policy training during your first week. These essential sessions will provide you with the foundational knowledge of our company standards, security protocols, and workplace policies necessary for your success.
- **Weeks 2-4:** During these weeks, you will shadow your assigned buddy and get introduced to ongoing projects. You will also have weekly check-ins with People Operations to discuss your progress and address any questions.
- **Weeks 5-12:** By this time, you will begin working on projects with your team and create your one-page Suzega Profile.
- **Weeks 12-24:** Upon successful completion of your 6 months probation period, you will transition to full-time team member status.
