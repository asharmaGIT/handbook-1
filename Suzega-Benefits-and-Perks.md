# **Benefits and Perks**

At Suzega, we focus on meaningful benefits rather than workplace distractions. No noisy environments, no foosball tables, and no gimmicks that ultimately hinder your productivity or encourage you to stay longer in the office. We understand that in each 24-hour day, your 8 working hours should be purposeful and focused, leaving 16 hours that belong completely to you. These hours are sacred—time for restorative sleep, personal health, family connections, and whatever brings you fulfillment outside of work. Our commitment to genuine work-life balance means we actively protect your boundaries, ensuring no expectations of after-hours work or weekend obligations. We believe that respecting your time isn't just a perk—it's the foundation of a healthy, sustainable workplace where professionals can thrive both in their careers and personal lives.

## **Our Philanthropy Pledge**

We pledge to dedicate 5% of our profits to philanthropic initiatives from the very first profitable year. This commitment reflects our core belief that giving back is not just an obligation but essential to our company’s purpose.

## **Profit Sharing**

Under the profit sharing program 10% of company profit is allocated for the distribution to eligible Team Members based on tenure. Team Members become eligible after completing 2 years of employment at Suzega, at which point they begin accruing 1 point per month of service in India and  3 points in USA. Points continue accumulating up to a maximum of 120 points for India and 360 points for USA (equivalent to 10 years of tenure).

The profit sharing distribution occurs annually in March for the previous year's profit, with the possibility that no distribution may occur in years without  sufficient profit as decided by the board at their own discretion.

Team Members forfeit accumulated points upon resignation or termination before the distribution date. The company reserves the right to modify or discontinue the program at its discretion.

**PLEASE NOTE:** The difference in the points accrued is a result of living cost differences between countries and is in line with the salary multiples observed in external benchmarked data.

##  **Ownership Pool**

We don't have plans to sell or take the company public. In case that happens, all team members may be eligible to receive a portion of the proceeds.  

At Suzega, we believe in sharing success with those who help create it. We've established an Ownership Pool designed to recognize team members who contribute to our growth journey. This discretionary pool represents our intention to allocate 15% of net proceeds from qualifying transactions (including mergers, acquisitions, or public offerings) to eligible full-time team members active at the time of such events. Distribution considerations may include factors such as tenure and individual contributions, as determined by leadership at the time of the event. While this pool reflects our values and intentions, it remains non-binding and fully discretionary, subject to modification based on business circumstances. 

Team Members forfeit right to participate in the Ownership Pool upon resignation or termination before the distribution date. The company reserves the right to modify or discontinue the program at its discretion.

## **Health and Retirement Benefits**

**For India :** In India, we provide a robust benefits package tailored to local needs and regulations. Health benefits include group medical insurance for employees and their dependents with the company covering 100% of premium costs. We partner with reputed insurance providers to deliver comprehensive coverage. Team members also have optional personal accident insurance, life insurance, and annual health check-ups.

Financial benefits align with local regulations and include Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) which is a part of CTC, Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) options, Gratuity benefits, and the option to participate in the National Pension System.

**For USA :** We provide a comprehensive benefits package designed to support the health, financial wellbeing, and work-life balance of our US Team Members. Our health coverage includes medical, dental, and vision insurance with the company covering 70% of premium costs while team members contribute the remaining 30%. We partner with reputed insurance providers to ensure quality coverage and service. Team Members also receive life insurance and disability coverage to provide security during unexpected circumstances.

For financial planning, we offer a 401(k) retirement plan where the company matches 100% of what you contribute, up to 4% of your salary, giving all team members the opportunity to build their future financial security. Team Members also have access to optional HSA/FSA accounts for additional tax-advantaged healthcare savings.

In both locations, we're committed to supporting employee wellbeing through comprehensive benefits that address health needs and financial security.

## **Home Office & Workspace Benefits**

We provide each team member with one time workspace allowance of $500 in the USA and INR 15,000 in India to create a comfortable and ergonomic home office setup. Use these funds for essential equipment, furniture, or whatever helps you work efficiently in your personal space. For team members unable to work from home, we will cover the costs of a coworking space membership, ensuring everyone has access to a productive environment. Please connect with the People Ops team if you have any questions.

## **Time- Off** 

You will receive 30 leaves per year in India and 15 in the USA which will be accumulated monthly on a pro-rata basis, plus 9 public holidays in India and USA. You will be allowed to carry forward up to 15 leaves every year and accumulate a maximum of 45 leaves. Any unused leaves beyond this limit will lapse.

While we follow an honor system and approval is not required, it's essential to communicate your planned absence with your project team and properly hand over your responsibilities to your designated backup Team member. This ensures both work continuity and that you won't be disturbed during your time away, allowing you to disconnect fully and rejuvenate.

We embrace a flexible approach to time off that prioritizes your wellbeing and work-life balance. If you require additional leave beyond your allocated balance, please contact the People Ops team directly. We will provide special leave allocations to ensure you don't face unpaid time off for reasonable cases. 

**Annual Rejuvenation Leave Allowance:**  
Every year, team members are encouraged to take a 1-week rejuvenation leave to rest, recharge, and return with renewed energy and perspective. To support this important time away, we provide  $1000 in the USA and INR 25,000 in India as a rejuvenation leave allowance that can be used toward travel, wellness activities, or however you choose to make your break most restorative.

**Please Note:** The rejuvenation leave allowance is only available when you take your 1-week rejuvenation leave in one continuous block. This benefit is applicable only once per year. If you don't take the full 1-week leave, you won't receive the allowance. The allowance doesn't roll over to the next year and can't be exchanged for cash. This policy reflects our commitment to meaningful breaks and complete disconnection from work.

For specific details about your benefits package, including coverage amounts, eligibility criteria, and enrollment procedures, please consult with our People Operations team.

**Unplug**: Our standard workday consists of 8 hours and 5 days, Team Members are not expected to be available or respond to work communications outside of working hours, including evenings, weekends, and holidays except in case of critical scenarios.

Each Friday, team members are encouraged to invest in expanding their skills, exploring new technologies, or deepening your expertise in areas relevant to your roles. In addition you can also contribute to our growing knowledge base, solutions, accelerators, open source projects and researching next generation technologies.
