# **Code of Conduct**

We take a fundamentally different approach to workplace conduct. Rather than imposing exhaustive rules and micromanaging behavior, we start from a place of respect and trust. We see our Team Members as they truly are: intelligent professionals with valuable experience and sound judgment. Your experience and common sense are your best guides for most situations you'll encounter.

That said, even the best communities need some shared norms. Here are ours:

**Bias towards action** \- We value forward momentum over perfect solutions. Make decisions, try new approaches, and adjust as needed rather than getting stuck in analysis paralysis.

**Continuous learning** \- Actively seek knowledge, embrace feedback, and view every challenge as an opportunity to grow. Share what you learn to elevate the entire team.

**No blame game** \- When things go wrong , focus on solutions, not finding someone to blame. We analyze failures to improve systems, not to point fingers.

**Open to diverse perspectives** \- The best solutions emerge when we consider multiple viewpoints. Actively seek out and genuinely consider opinions different from your own.

**Speak directly** \- Address issues with people, not about them. If something's wrong, talk to the person who can fix it rather than complaining elsewhere.

**Report Misconduct** \- While we prioritize trust and professional judgment, we also recognize our shared responsibility to maintain a respectful workplace. We encourage you to speak up when minor issues arise, but require reporting of any behavior that creates a hostile environment, including all kinds of harassment (including sexual harassment), discrimination, intimidation, or zero tolerance for disrespectful conduct. You can report concerns directly to the People Ops team. All reports are handled with discretion, thoroughness, and fairness, with prompt investigation and appropriate action while protecting privacy. We have zero tolerance for retaliation against anyone who reports concerns in good faith or participates in an investigation. Remember, we can only address issues we know aboutâ€”by speaking up, you help maintain this respectful community we all value.

**Non-Discrimination** \- We are committed to fostering a workplace where everyone feels valued and respected. We firmly believe in providing equal opportunities to all team members and applicants, ensuring that everyone has a fair chance to contribute and succeed.

Our commitment to equality means that we do not discriminate on any grounds, including Race, Caste, Religion, Color, Ancestry, Marital Status, Gender, Sexual Orientation, Age, Nationality, Ethnic Origin, or Disability.

We also prohibit discrimination based on any other category protected by applicable law. We are dedicated to creating a work environment where everyone feels a sense of belonging. We believe that our workforce enriches our perspectives, fosters innovation, and strengthens our ability to serve our clients and communities.
