# **Design Your Growth**

We follow a personalized performance management approach called "Design Your Growth." This framework puts you in control of your professional development, helping you shape your career in ways that match both your goals and our company's needs.

Design Your Growth plan helps you:

**Define Your Vision and Goals:** We guide you in identifying both long-term career aspirations and short-term professional objectives that are meaningful to you. This clarity creates purpose and direction in your daily work.

**Prototype Your Career Path:** Rather than following rigid, predefined career ladders, you will create a customized path aligned with your unique strengths and interests. This flexible approach allows for exploration and pivoting as opportunities emerge.

**Gain Visibility on Your Career Trajectory:** Through regular check-ins and feedback, you will clearly see where you stand now and what skills and experiences you need to move forward. This clarity helps you plan your development effectively.

**Build a Strong Foundation:** We invest in your growth by making room for deliberate learning, which helps you develop skills essential for both current success and future advancement.

We assess performance based on mastery, accountability, autonomy, and collaboration.

This approach turns performance management into an ongoing partnership focused on your continuous growth and success with us.

## **Self Management**

We've embraced self-management, incorporating best practices from Holacracy, Humanocracy, and Reinventing Organizations to create a system that enables autonomy, mastery, and personal growth.

In our organization, self-management means:

* Decision-making happens through consultation rather than approval  
* Anyone can make decisions after seeking input from affected colleagues  
* Performance is driven by intrinsic motivation, peer transparency, and market demands  
* We trust people to act in alignment with our shared purpose  
* Conflicts are resolved directly between individuals, without blame  
* Information flows freely to where it's needed most

This approach replaces traditional hierarchy with distributed authority and peer relationships. By giving you the freedom to make meaningful decisions, develop your skills, and align your work with your values, we create an environment where everyone can reach their full potential.

We join forward-thinking organizations like Buurtzorg, Patagonia, and others who have demonstrated that self-management liberates energy, reduces bureaucratic waste, and creates more effective, purposeful, and humane workplaces.
